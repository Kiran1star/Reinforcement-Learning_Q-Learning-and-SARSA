# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Grid-World
<h3>Goal:</h3>

* The goal is to acquire experience in defining and solving reinforcement learning environments,
following OpenAI Gym standards. 

<h3>Problem: </h3> 

* Part 1: The first focuses on defining deterministic and stochastic environments based on the Markov decision process. 
* Part 2: In the second part, I applied two tabular methods (i.e. SARSA and Q-Learning) to solve environments that were previously defined
